My first trip was an incredible experience that I will never forget. I traveled to Paris with my family and was immediately struck by the city's beauty and history. We visited famous landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral, and enjoyed strolling along the Seine River.
