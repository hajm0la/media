One of my favorite memories was trying French cuisine for the first time. I tasted delicious croissants, pain au chocolat, and macarons that were unlike 
any pastries I had ever had before. We also visited a local market and bought fresh bread, cheese, and fruit for a picnic in a park, which was a wonderful
way to experience Parisian life.
